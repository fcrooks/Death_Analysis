# Science of Aging
Aging is the underlying cause of most major diseases (some argue that itâ€™s a disease itself). Therefore, a more effective intervention would be to treat aging directly rather than the hundreds of ailments that occur further downstream. Transitioning to this approach would have a tremendous effect on many different aspects of society. Breakthroughs in medical research would have an exponential impact, healthcare costs would decrease dramatically, and most importantly, human life/healthspans would greatly improve.
